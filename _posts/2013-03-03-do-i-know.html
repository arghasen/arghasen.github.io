<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">"If we knew what we were doing,it wont be called Research"-Albert Einstein.<br />I saw it one fine day, walking down the road in 2010 in NIT Rourkela , one of the many quotes that are on the painted placards,a thing that always pleased.<br />Initially it was met with a bit of laughter,as often happened in company of Kamaljeet Singh,Vivek Bhatt and Ankur Samantara,in fact it turned into a joke on Kamaljeet.And as it happens with us,it was forgotten and lost in the sands of time.<br />&nbsp;It was 2012,I had been an intern in CISCO for quite some time, posted picture on Facebook, with some code running in the background,about which I had no idea,so when someone asked about it, in a sudden flash of mind,came the answer, an improvised version of Einstein's quote.I felt I had finally understood why he had said it.<br /><br />Cut to 2013,a few days back, working on my Masters project, with Prabal Ghosh,on a problem that we got a week before,but as engineers it is a crime to work before submission date,as work went into the night,doubts crept in,got reworked,before all of a sudden he commented out "Why the hell are we doing this? I cant see how all this models and mathematics is leading us to the solution",a statement made in complete consciousness, by a nocturnal creature,Einstein's quote came back flashing.I had got a new meaning of it,probably he was also flustered by the lack of progress.<br /><br />Why I made this post,mostly because the quote seems to come back to me,after seemingly long periods of time,partly because I am free on a sunday morning, and in a slight grain of mind I dont know why?<br /><br />PS:- If you all have seen this post,feel ill at ease with the number of commas,long sentences,that is due to me reading Mortimer Adler last night.</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:130%;"><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">Ethnic violence</span></i><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">, a term often predominantly framed rhetorically by causes and issues related to </span></i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_hatred" title="Ethnic hatred"><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">ethnic hatred</span></i></a><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">, though ethnic violence is often related to </span></i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence" title="Political violence"><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">political violence</span></i></a><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">. But the situation is of much graver consequences if ethnic violence is put off in the pretext of terrorism; although it ethnic violence accounts up as right-wing extremism.<o:p></o:p></span></i></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:130%;"><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">The same can be learnt from the recent ethnic clashes in Assam. The violence has been between Bodo tribe’s people and immigrant Muslims has raised some indelible questions about the in the minds of the people. Why was no action taken by the government when the same districts had been under violence in August? </span></i><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">The Government failed to take adequate measures like deployment of additional forces to prevent recurrence of such incidents and the same areas faced violent ethnic clashes once again. The Government has been claiming that members of the National Democratic Front Boroland (NDFB); a terrorist organization were involved in the incident. The fact that</span></i><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;"> four cadres of the NDFB were arrested in the area only highlights the issue.</span></i><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;"> The Government should take up the issue with the leadership of the NDFB strongly as NDFB is with a ceasefire with the government.<o:p></o:p></span></i></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:130%;"><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">The clashes of such a large magnitude between the ethnic groups had an official death toll of over 60 and rendered over a lakh homeless. With the situation under control due to strong action under the army; the Government must institute a thorough probe to find out the persons responsible for instigating the miscreants to indulge in killing of innocents as cross sections of people, who were living peacefully in the area for years would not have indulged in such clashes without any instigation. <o:p></o:p></span></i></span></p>  <span style="font-size:130%;"><i style=""><span style="line-height: 115%;">The contrivance of ethnic violence has been the most potent weapon in the hands of the militants for years now and they are now moving into places earlier unknown in the realms of ethnic violence. The Assam incident should be an eye-opener for the government as well as the Indian citizens.</span><span style="line-height: 115%;"> It is upon us that we ensure communal harmony in the testing times and also thwart the extremists to ensure India is secular both in body and spirit.</span></i></span>

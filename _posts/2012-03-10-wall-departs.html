<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This blog is becoming more of a tribute to great cricketers and continuing this is next in line about Rahul Dravid. In an era where classical batsmanship is losing out to attractive strokeplay,maybe he was the last of cricket's true worshipers. In the days before the cable tv era at my house, with a transistor under the pillow, listening to the commentary on AIR, repetitive tone of <i>"Dravid defends and no run"</i> used to be the music of the theatrical called test cricket,dotted with ecstatic <i>"ye Dabur Chawanprash Chowka"</i>. And if you think he was dour,we have seen his 22 ball 50 that would give Shewag a run for his money.<br /><br />"The Wall" as he was called but we must remember he didn't like it. His best knocks have come in overseas tests where he built famous victories.Who can forget Headinglay(2002),Adeliade(2003),Rawalpindi(2004), Kingston(2010)? Who can forget the Kolkatta turnaround(2001)?<br /><br />His calming influence in the middle allowed the more attacking batsmen to express themselves even in onedayers. Remember Sachin's 186, Ganguly's 183,Sachin's 140,Shewag(108),Gauti(103)&nbsp; and Sanjay Bangar's amazing 57 overshadowing centuries by Dravid.<br /><br />A complete team man who opened batting,kept wickets for team balance will be remembered through history as the man who played the most number of balls in test cricket. With the number of test matches not increasing and strike rates going high it may be a figure like Bradman's Average, no one might surpass.<br />To Quote him verbatim <i>"I wouldn't like to name one Indian player. I think there is a huge  group of players that can be better than Rahul Dravid. I'm sure in 16-17  years' time you will be attending a press conference of a player who  has probably done a lot more than I have.".&nbsp;</i><br />For India's sake we hope it is true.<i>&nbsp;</i> <br /><br /><br /></div>

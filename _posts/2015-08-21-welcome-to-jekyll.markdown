I have fleeted with the idea of blogging for long but with 7 posts in 7 years, 
it is certainly not been something I have paid a lot of attention to. So a
completely new approach to my blogging seemed necessary. Suddenly yesterday
Jekyll caught my attention. I had seen it about an year ago but didn't pay much
attention to it. This time though I am liking what I see and so I have decided
to change my blogging to Jekyll engine. 

I don't know whether it is a long term relationship or a fleeting pasttime, but
it is certinly giving me joy at the moment. Or perhaps it is just the ego boost
from the tagline of Jekyll 'Blogging for hackers'.
